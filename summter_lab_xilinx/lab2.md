# Adding IP cores in PL

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
*	Configure the GP Master port of the PS to connect to IP in the PL
*	Add additional IP to a hardware design
*	Setup some of the compiler settings

## Steps

### Open the Project

1. Open the previous project
2.	Select **File > Project > Save As…** to open the Save Project As dialog box. Enter **lab2** as the project name.  Make sure that the **Create Project Subdirectory** option is checked, the project directory path is **{labs}** and click OK.
This will create the lab2 directory and save the project and associated directory with lab2 name.

### Add Two Instances of GPIO

1.	In the Sources panel, expand system_wrapper, and double-click on the system.bd (system_i) file to invoke IP Integrator.
2.	Double click on the Zynq block in the diagram to open the Zynq configuration window.
3.	Select **PS-PL Configuration** page menu on the left.
4.	Expand **AXI Non Secure Enablement > GP Master AXI Interfaces**, if necessary, and click on Enable **M_AXI_GP0 interface** check box under the field to enable the AXI GP0 port.
5.	Expand **General > Enable Clock Resets** and select the FCLK_RESET0_N option.
6.	Select the **Clock Configuration** tab on the left. Expand the **PL Fabric Clocks** and select the FCLK_CLK0 option (with requested clock frequency of 100.000000 MHz) and click OK.
7.	Notice the additional *M_AXI_GPO* interface, and *M_AXI_GPO_ACLK*, *FCLK_CLK0*, and *FCLK_RESET0_N* ports are now included on the Zynq block. You can click the regenerate button to redraw the diagram to get something like this:

</p>
<p align = "center">
<i>Zynq system with AXI and clock interfaces</i>
</p>

8.	Next add an IP by **right clicking on the Diagram window> Add IP** and search for AXI GPIO in the catalog

9.	Double-click the _AXI GPIO_ to add the core to the design. The core will be added to the design and the block diagram will be updated.

10.	Click on the AXI GPIO block to select it, and in the properties tab, change the name to **switches**

   </p>
   <p align = "center">
   <i>Change AXI GPIO default name</i>
   </p>

11.	Double click on the _AXI GPIO block_ to open the customization window.
12.	Click the **Board** tag, From the **Board Interface** drop down, select **sws 2bits** for **GPIO** IP Interface.
13.	Next, click the IP configuration tab, and notice the width has already been set to match the switches on the *PYNQ-Z2* (2)  

    Notice that the peripheral can be configured for two channels, but, since we want to use only one channel without interrupt, leave the **Enable Dual Channel** and **Enable Interrupt** unchecked.  

14.	Click OK to save and close the customization window
15.	Notice that **Designer assistance** is available. Click on Run Connection Automation, and select **/switches/S_AXI**
16.	Click OK when prompted to automatically connect the master and slave interfaces. Notice that two additional blocks, Processor System Reset, and AXI Interconnect have automatically been added to the design. (The blocks can be dragged to be rearranged, or the design can be redrawn.).

   </p>

17.	Add another instance of the GPIO peripheral (Add IP). Name it as **buttons**
19.	Double click on the IP block, in the **GPIO interface** select **btns 4bits** for the _PYNQ-Z2_, click OK.

    At this point connection automation could be run, or the block could be connected manually. This time the block will be connected manually.
20.	Double click on the _AXI Interconnect_ (name : ps7_0_axi_periph) and change the Number of **Master Interfaces** to 2 and click OK

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="pics/lab2/4_AXIrecust.jpg "  width="60%" height="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Add master port to AXI Interconnect</i>
    </p>

21.	Click on the **s_axi** port of the buttons AXI GPIO block (name: buttons), and drag the pointer towards the AXI Interconnect block.

      The message "Found 1 interface" should appear, and a green tick should appear beside the M01_AXI port on the AXI Interconnect indicating this is a valid port to connect to. Drag the pointer to this port and release the mouse button to make the connection.
22.	In a similar way, connect the following ports:

    *buttons s_axi_aclk -> Zynq7 Processing System  FCLK_CLK0*

    *buttons s_axi_aresetn -> Processor System Reset peripheral_aresetn*

    *AXI Interconnect M01_ACLK -> Zynq7 Processing System  FCLK_CLK0*

    *AXI Interconnect M01_ARESETN -> Processor System Reset peripheral_aresetn*

    The block diagram should look similar to this:

    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>System Assembly View after Adding the Peripherals</i>
    </p>

23.	Click on the **Address Editor** tab, and expand **processing_system7_0/Data > Unassigned Slaves** if necessary
24.	Notice that switches has been automatically assigned an address, but buttons has not (since it was manually connected). Right click on **/buttons/S_AXI** and select **Assign**.

Note that both peripherals are assigned in the address range of _0x40000000_ to _0x7FFFFFFF_ (GP0 range).

### Make GPIO Peripheral Connections External
   <!--
   3-1.	The push button and dip switch instances will be connected to corresponding pins on the board.  This can be done manually, or using Designer Assistance.  Normally, one would consult the board’s user manual to find this information.
   -->
1.	In the Diagram view, notice that **Designer Assistance** is available. We will manually create the ports and connect.
2.	Right-Click on the _GPIO port_ of the switches instance and select **Make External** to create the external port. This will create the external port named **GPIO_0** and connect it to the peripheral. Because Vivado is “board aware”, the pin constraints will be automatically applied to the port.
3.	Select the **GPIO_0** port and change the name to **switches** in its properties form.
The width of the interface will be automatically determined by the upstream block.
4.	For the buttons GPIO, click on the **Run Connection Automation** link.
5.	In the opened GUI, select **btns_4bits** (for _PYNQ-Z2_) under the options section.
6.	Click OK.
7.	Select the created external port and change its name as **buttons**.
8.	Run Design Validation (**Tools -> Validate Design**) and verify there are no errors.

    The design should now look similar to the diagram below

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="pics/lab2/7_Finaldsgn.jpg "  width="80%" height="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Completed design</i>
    </p>

9.	In the Flow Navigator, click **Run Synthesis**. (Click Save if prompted) and when synthesis completes, select Open Synthesized Design  and click OK
10.	 In the shortcut Bar, select **I/O Planning** from the Layout dropdown menu

   <p align="center">
   <img src ="pics/lab2/8_iop.jpg"  width="30%" height="80%"/>
   </p>
   <p align = "center">
   <i>Switch to the IO planning view</i>
   </p>

11.	In the I/O ports tab, expand the two GPIO icons, and expand *buttons_tri_i*, and *switches_tri_i*, and notice that the ports have been automatically assigned pin locations, along with the other Fixed IO ports in the design, and an I/O Std of _LVCMOS33_ (*PYNQ-Z2*) has been applied. If they were not automatically applied, pin constraints can be included in a constraints file, or entered manually or modified through the I/O Ports tab.

    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Add IP to Block Diagram</i>
    </p>        


1.	Once the **IP Catalog** opens, type “zynq” into the Search bar, find and double click on **ZYNQ7 Processing System** entry, or click on the entry and hit the Enter key to add it to the design.

1.	Notice the message at the top of the Diagram window in a green label saying that Designer Assistance available. Click **Run Block Automation**.  

1.	A new window pops up called the Run Block Automation window. In it, select **/processing_system7_0**, leave the default settings and click OK

1. Once Block Automation has been complete, notice that ports have been automatically added for the DDR and Fixed IO, and some additional ports are now visible. The imported configuration for the Zynq related to the board has been applied which will now be modified. The block should finally look like this:

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="pics/lab1/5_Zynqblck.jpg" width="90%" height="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
     <i> Zynq Block with DDR and Fixed IO ports</i>
    </p>  

1. Double-click on the added block to open its **Customization** window.
   Notice now the Customization window shows selected peripherals (with tick marks). This is the default configuration for the board applied by the block automation.

###	Configure the processing block with just UART 1 peripheral enabled.

1.	A block diagram of the Zynq should now be open again, showing various configurable blocks of the **Processing System**.

1. At this stage, the designer can click on various configurable blocks (highlighted in green) and change the system configuration.

1.	Click on one of the peripherals (in green) in the **Peripheral I/O Pins** block of the Zynq Block Design, or select the **MIO Configuration** tab on the left to open the configuration form

1.	Expand **Peripheral I/O Pins** if necessary, and ensure all the following I/O peripherals are deselected except UART 1.

    >**Note :** Select UART 0 for PYNQ-Z2 instead of UART 1


    i.e. Remove: &nbsp; <i>ENET
    
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USB 0
    
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SD 0
    
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expand **GPIO** to deselect GPIO MIO
    
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expand **Memory Interfaces** to deselect Quad SPI Flash
    
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expand **Application Processor Unit** to disable Timer 0.

    <i> The HDL Wrapper file generated and added to the project </i>
    </p>  

1. Notice that the Verilog file is already set as the top module in the design, indicated by the icon.
1. Select **File > Export > Export hardware** and click OK. (Save the project if prompted)
Note:  Since we do not have any hardware in Programmable Logic (PL) there is no bitstream to generate, hence the Include bitstream option is not necessary at this time.

1. Basic information about the hardware configuration of the project can be found in the Xilinx Support Archive (XSA) file, along with the Address maps for the PS systems, and driver information. The .xsa file is used in the software environment to determine the peripherals available in the system, and their location in the address map.

### Generate Memory Test Application in Vitis IDE

1. Select **Tools > Launch Vitis IDE**, and Select the workspace location with any given location path. Click Launch. The Vitis IDE opens.
1. Review the Welcome page and close it. Click **Create Application Project**, and click Next.
3. In the Platform Selection window, select **Create a new platform from hardware (XSA)** and browse to select the system_wrapper.xsa file exported before. (Default is in the {labs}\lab1 folder)
1. Enter **lab1_platform** as the _Platform name_, click **Next.**

## Conclusion

Vivado and the IP Integrator allow base embedded processor systems and applications to be generated very quickly. After the system has been defined, the hardware can be exported and Vitis IDE can be invoked from Vivado.

Software development is done in Vitis IDE which provides several application templates including memory tests.  You verified the operation of the hardware by using a test application, executing on the processor, and observing the output in the serial terminal window.

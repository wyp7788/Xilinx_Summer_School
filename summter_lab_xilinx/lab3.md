     A Virtex 7 part is chosen for this project, but later compatibility for other devices will be added to the packaged IP.

###	Run the Create and Package IP Wizard

1.	Select **Tools > Create and Package New IP**
2.	In the window, click Next
3.	Select **Create a new AXI4 peripheral**, and click Next
4.	Fill in the details for the IP

    Name: *led_ip*

    Display Name: *led_ip_v1_0*

    (Fill in a description, Vendor Name, and URL)

5.	Click Next
6.	Change the Name of the interface to **S_AXI**
7.	Leave the other settings as default and click **Next** (*Lite interface, Slave mode, Data Width: 32, Number of Registers: 4*)

8.	Select **Edit IP** and click **Finish** (a new Vivado Project will open)

###	Create an interface to the LEDs

1.	In the sources panel, double-click the led_ip_v1_0.v file.

     This file contains the HDL code for the interface(s) selected above. The top level file contains a module which implements the AXI interfacing logic, and an example design to write to and read from the number of registers specified above. This template can be used as a basis for creating custom IP. A new parameterized output port to the LEDs will be created at the top level of the design, and the AXI write data in the sub-module will be connected back up to the external LED port.

     Scroll down to line 7 where a user parameters space is provided.  
2.	Add the line:

    ```verilog
    7   parameter integer LED_WIDTH = 8,
    ```

3.	Go to line 18 and add the line:

    ```verilog
    18  output wire [LED_WIDTH-1:0] LED,
    ```
    > don't forget to add commas when adding a port

4.	Insert the following at line ~48:
    ```verilog
    48  .LED_WIDTH(LED_WIDTH),
    ```
5.	Insert the following at line ~52:
    ```verilog
    52  .LED(LED),
    ```


6.	Save the file by selecting **File > Save File**
7.	Expand led_ip_v1_0 in the sources view if necessary, and open led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI.v
8.	Add the LED parameter and port to this file too, at lines 7 and 18 (done in steps 2 ands 3)

9.	Scroll down to ~line 400 and insert the following code to instantiate the user logic for the LED IP
(This code can be typed directly, or copied from the user_logic_instantiation.txt file in the lab3 source folder.)

    ```verilog
    lab3_user_logic  # (
        .LED_WIDTH(LED_WIDTH)
    )
    U1(
        .S_AXI_ACLK(S_AXI_ACLK),
        .slv_reg_wren(slv_reg_wren),
        .axi_awaddr(axi_awaddr[C_S_AXI_ADDR_WIDTH-1:ADDR_LSB]),
        .S_AXI_WDATA(S_AXI_WDATA),
        .S_AXI_ARESETN(S_AXI_ARESETN),
        .LED(LED)
    );
    ```
    Check all the signals that are being connected and where they originate.

10.	Save the file by selecting **File > Save File**
11.	Click on the **Add Sources** in the Flow Navigator pane, select **Add or Create Design Sources**, click **Next**, then click the Plus icon then Add Files…, browse to **{sources}\lab3**, select the lab3_user_logic.v file and click OK, and then click **Finish** to add the file.

    Check the contents of this file to understand the logic that is being implemented.  Notice the formed hierarchy.

    > Make sure that when adding the source lab3_user_logic.v, untick the option: Copy sources into IP directory

12.	Click **Run Synthesis** and **Save** if prompted. (This is to check the design synthesizes correctly before packaging the IP. If this was your own design, you would  simulate it and verify functionality before proceeding)
13.	Check the _Messages_ tab for any errors and correct if necessary before moving to the next step

    When Synthesis completes successfully, click Cancel.

###	Package the IP

1.	Click on the Package IP – led_ip tab

## Conclusion

Vivado IP packager was used to import a custom IP block into the IP library. The IP block was then added to the system. Connection automation was run where available to speed up the design of the system by allowing Vivado to automatically make connections between IP. An additional BRAM was added to the design. Finally, pin location constraints were added to the design.
